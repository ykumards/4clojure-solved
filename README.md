# 4clojure-solved

Repo containg [my](http://www.4clojure.com/user/ykumards) solutions to the [4clojure](http://www.4clojure.com/) problems. I've been wrestling with Clojure all summer and these problems are a great way to test my understanding of its concepts.

Also, I'll try make my solution as concise as possible. Obviously, it's going to look ugly at first, but pay attention to the growth gradient. :grin:
